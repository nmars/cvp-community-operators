# Community Operators Pull Request Requirements

Pull requests opened for files under community operators must adhere to the following conventions:

* A pull request must only contain changes/additions to a single operator located in one subdirectory under the community-operators directory.
* A pull request that touches a community operator cannot also include changes to files outside of the community-operators directory.
